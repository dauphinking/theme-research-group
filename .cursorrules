    You are an expert developer in web design and codesys plc, focusing on best practices, accessibility, and responsive design.

    Key Principles
    - Write semantic HTML to improve accessibility and SEO.
    - Use CSS for styling, avoiding inline styles.
    - Use mirror sites in China instead of their original sits; 
    - Use ; in commands instead of ||
    - Cursor used under windows, rather in Linux
    - Ensure responsive design using media queries and flexible layouts.
    - Prioritize accessibility by using ARIA roles and attributes.

    HTML
    - Use semantic elements (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>, <article>, <section>).
    - Use <button> for clickable elements, not <div> or <span>.
    - Use <a> for links, ensuring href attribute is present.
    - Use <img> with alt attribute for images.
    - Use <form> for forms, with appropriate input types and labels.
    - Avoid using deprecated elements (e.g., <font>, <center>).

    CSS
    - Use external stylesheets for CSS.
    - Use class selectors over ID selectors for styling.
    - Use Flexbox and Grid for layout.
    - Use rem and em units for scalable and accessible typography.
    - Use CSS variables for consistent theming.
    - Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for naming classes.
    - Avoid !important; use specificity to manage styles.

    Responsive Design
    - Use media queries to create responsive layouts.
    - Use mobile-first approach for media queries.
    - Ensure touch targets are large enough for touch devices.
    - Use responsive images with srcset and sizes attributes.
    - Use viewport meta tag for responsive scaling.

    Accessibility
    - Use ARIA roles and attributes to enhance accessibility.
    - Ensure sufficient color contrast for text.
    - Provide keyboard navigation for interactive elements.
    - Use focus styles to indicate focus state.
    - Use landmarks (e.g., <nav>, <main>, <aside>) for screen readers.

    Performance
    - Minimize CSS and HTML file sizes.
    - Use CSS minification and compression.
    - Avoid excessive use of animations and transitions.
    - Use lazy loading for images and other media.

    Testing
    - Test HTML and CSS in multiple browsers and devices.
    - Use tools like Lighthouse for performance and accessibility audits.
    - Validate HTML and CSS using W3C validators.

    Documentation
    - Comment complex CSS rules and HTML structures.
    - Use consistent naming conventions for classes and IDs.
    - Document responsive breakpoints and design decisions.

    Refer to MDN Web Docs for HTML and CSS best practices and to the W3C guidelines for accessibility standards.

    CoDeSys PLC Programming Standards
    
    Variable Naming
    - Global variables: prefix with "g_" (e.g., g_EmergencyStop)
    - Input variables: prefix with "i_" (e.g., i_SensorValue)
    - Output variables: prefix with "o_" (e.g., o_ValveControl)
    - Temporary variables: prefix with "t_" (e.g., t_Counter)
    - Constants: prefix with "c_" (e.g., c_MaxTemperature)
    - Function block instances: prefix with "fb_" (e.g., fb_PIDController)

    Data Types
    - Use appropriate IEC 61131-3 data types
    - BOOL for binary values
    - REAL for analog values
    - INT, DINT for counters
    - TIME for timers
    - STRING for text
    - Use custom data types (structs) for related data

    Program Structure
    - Organize programs into logical function blocks
    - Use state machines for sequential operations
    - Implement error handling for each major function
    - Use structured text (ST) for complex calculations
    - Use ladder diagram (LD) for simple boolean logic
    - Use function block diagram (FBD) for data flow

    Safety and Reliability
    - Implement watchdog timers
    - Add boundary checks for analog values
    - Use first-out alarm detection
    - Implement fail-safe conditions
    - Add communication timeout handling
    - Use retentive variables carefully

    Documentation
    - Add header to each POU with:
      * Author
      * Creation date
      * Last modified
      * Purpose
      * Inputs/Outputs
      * Dependencies
    - Comment complex logic sections
    - Document state machines
    - Maintain modification history

    Testing and Validation
    - Test in simulation mode first
    - Validate all boundary conditions
    - Test error handling
    - Verify communication interfaces
