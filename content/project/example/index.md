The lab’s self-funded project aimed to enhance robot-environment interaction by developing hardware platforms and control algorithms for rigid-soft hybrid robots. An input mapping module was introduced in the visual servoing system to mitigate disturbances and improve response speed.


**Display Layer:**

* **Human-Machine Interaction Interface:**

   Developed using Qt for user-friendly operation and visualization.

**Service Layer:**

* **Control Module:**

   Designed to handle the primary control logic.
* **Image Processing Module:**

   Responsible for processing visual data, implemented using Python and MATLAB.

**Communication Layer:**

* **Serial Communication Protocols:**

   Includes RS and USB interfaces for data transfer and parsing.

**Hardware Layer:**

* **Rigid Robotic Arm:**

   The main manipulator providing structural support and precision.
* **Soft Mechanism:**

   Integrated for enhanced compliance and adaptability.
* **High-Precision Camera:**

   Ensures accurate visual data acquisition.
* **Miniature Camera:**

   For additional visual inputs in constrained or detailed environments.

This layered architecture ensures seamless integration of software and hardware components, enabling precise and reliable operation in visual servo applications.
