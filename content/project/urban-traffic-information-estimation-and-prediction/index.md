**Data Integration:** Combines GPS, video surveillance, public transit, and other sources to create a comprehensive data framework.

**Prediction Model:** Utilizes variable-order Markov models (VOMM) and dynamic rule mining for short-term multi-step traffic forecasts.

**Challenges Addressed:** Tackles issues like discontinuity in traffic mode transitions and complexity in multi-layer network couplings.

**Outcome:** Improves accuracy and efficiency in predicting urban traffic patterns, enabling proactive management strategies.
