* **Aggregation MPC (Model Predictive Control)**:

  * Introduced a generalized linear aggregation framework for MPC.
  * Developed equivalent aggregation concepts to simplify optimization problems, enabling real-time applicability.
  * Optimized the separation between offline (design phase) and online (real-time execution) computations to ensure high efficiency.
* **Applications**:

  * **Air Separation Systems**

    :
  * **Injection Molding Systems**

    :
  * **Photovoltaic Inverter Systems**

    :
* **Energy Savings**: Achieved average coal savings of 6%, with a peak efficiency of 8% in relevant processes.
