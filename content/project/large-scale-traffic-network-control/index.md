**Hierarchical Structure:**

Upper Level: Balances traffic flow between regions to prevent oversaturation.

Lower Level: Focuses on localized signal timing optimization for intersections.Lower Levelï¼š

Model-Based Control: Utilizes MFD (Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram) to regulate traffic flow and maintain stability below critical density.

Scalable Application: Ensures efficient coordination of traffic across subregions, enhancing overall network performance.

Simulation Results: Demonstrates improved flow rates and reduced travel times in test scenarios.
