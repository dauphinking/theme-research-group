Single Intersection Control: Implements Markov decision processes (MDP) to dynamically adjust green signal durations based on traffic conditions.

Arterial Road Optimization: Introduces green wave synchronization for multiple intersections to improve flow efficiency.

Network-Level Control: Applies centralized and distributed predictive algorithms to optimize signal timing across large networks.

**Key Metrics:** Focuses on reducing vehicle queues, delays, and stops while maximizing road throughput.

**User Interface:** Features intuitive dashboards for real-time data visualization and optimization output.
