title: Traffic Signal Optimization Software
date: 2024-12-25T15:34:00.000Z
summary: >-
  Single Intersection Control: Implements Markov decision processes (MDP) to
  dynamically adjust green signal durations based on traffic conditions.


  Arterial Road Optimization: Introduces green wave synchronization for multiple intersections to improve flow efficiency.


  Network-Level Control: Applies centralized and distributed predictive algorithms to optimize signal timing across large networks.


  **Key Metrics:** Focuses on reducing vehicle queues, delays, and stops while maximizing road throughput.


  **User Interface:** Features intuitive dashboards for real-time data visualization and optimization output.
