Recently, the launch ceremony of the "Intelligent Manufacturing System Control Joint Laboratory" led by Professor Dewei Li from the School of Automation and Perception at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, in collaboration with Midea Group Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Midea Group"), was held at the Midea Intelligent Manufacturing Research Institute in Midea Global Innovation Center.

Professor Hesheng Wang and Professor Dewei Li from the School of Automation and Perception at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Dr. Shaoying He, Dr. Ming Su, Assistant to the Director of Midea Group's Intelligent Manufacturing Research Institute, Dr. Debin Yin, Director of the Intelligent Equipment Research Institute, and Han Li, Professional Support Manager, attended the ceremony. The ceremony was hosted by Han Li from Midea Group.

Ming Su fully acknowledged the establishment of the "Intelligent Manufacturing System Control Joint Laboratory" and expressed hope that Shanghai Jiao Tong University could leverage its deep background and technical advantages in automation-related fields to help Midea Group achieve rapid development in intelligent manufacturing and solve enterprise challenges. Hesheng Wang welcomed the cooperation between Midea Group and the School of Automation and Perception at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and expressed earnest hopes for both parties to leverage their strengths, promote the integration of industry and education, and contribute to the development of intelligent manufacturing in both enterprises and the nation. Subsequently, Debin Yin and Dewei Li introduced the development direction of the laboratory from aspects such as industry-university-research integration, addressing industry pain points, and technical implementation.

During the symposium, Shaoying He delivered a special report titled "Research on Data-Driven Visual Servo Control." Dr. He systematically organized and provided a detailed introduction to industrial intelligent robot technology, focusing on the development trends of intelligent robots, embodied intelligence technology, and data-driven servo control, all centered around the current development of industrial robots. The report generated significant attention and interest from relevant engineers at Midea Group.

The School of Automation and Perception at Shanghai Jiao Tong University has always been committed to scientific research innovation and deep integration of industry, academia, and research. The establishment of this joint laboratory represents a solid step for the school in the field of intelligent manufacturing. The Complex Systems CSCLab of the School of Automation and Perception will fully leverage its advantages in technical research and talent resources, closely aligning with Midea Group's industrial layout and development direction. The collaboration will focus on manufacturing scenarios such as home appliances, buildings, and industrial components, conducting comprehensive cooperation in multiple dimensions including production process modeling analysis and control optimization, as well as quality modeling and inspection of process products and finished products. In the future, the school will continue to deepen scientific research innovation, strengthen cooperation with industry, inject more vitality into promoting intelligent manufacturing technology progress and cultivating high-end talent, and help China advance to a higher level in the global intelligent manufacturing field.
