Recently, the launch meeting of the National Key R&D Program for Clean and Efficient Coal Utilization Technology - "Key Technologies and Equipment for Coal Conversion Process Closed-Loop Control System" was held at the Minhang Campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Led by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, this project brings together eight top domestic research institutions and enterprises, including Tsinghua University, Central South University, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Shanxi Institute of Coal Chemistry (Chinese Academy of Sciences), HOLLiAS Kayoubei Technology Co., Ltd., Yucheng Xuyang Energy Co., Ltd., and Cangzhou Xuyang Chemical Co., Ltd. The project aims to overcome key technical bottlenecks in the refined management and control of the coal chemical industry, promote green and efficient development in China's coal chemical industry, and support the country in building a secure, self-reliant new energy system.

Professor Qiu Yegao, Dean of the Frontier Innovation Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Professor Han Tao, Party Secretary of the School of Automation and Perception, attended the launch meeting. The expert panel providing strategic support for the project consists of authoritative scholars in coal chemical engineering, automation, and process control, including Professor Yao Qiang (Tsinghua University/Xinjiang University), Researcher Ye Mao (Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences), Professor Zhao Jun (Dalian University of Technology), Professor Han Honggui (Beijing University of Technology), Professor Zou Tao (Guangzhou University), Senior Engineer Jiang Jingliang (Shanghai Boiler Works Co., Ltd.), and Senior Engineer Zhao Hengping (Sinopec Technology). The meeting was chaired by Professor Han Tao.

In his speech, Professor Qiu Yegao emphasized that "clean and efficient coal utilization" plays a significant role in building China's secure and self-reliant new energy system. He expressed his expectation that the project, leveraging the university's long-term expertise in automation and collaborating with top domestic teams, would promote the development of self-reliant and reliable management and control software systems for China's coal chemical industry, providing "SJTU solutions" for the industry's intelligent upgrading and green development.

Professor Li Dewei, the project leader, gave a detailed report on various aspects of the project, including background and technical routes, task setup and research plans, assessment indicators and expected outcomes, progress arrangements and implementation plans, and management systems and risk analysis. He stated that Shanghai Jiao Tong University would adhere to application-oriented principles to overcome core technical challenges, strengthen collaborative cooperation to consolidate industry innovation, and strictly adhere to scientific research standards to ensure project quality.

Subsequently, Yuan Zhihong, Chen Xiaofang, Wang Mengzhi, and Huang Zhenlin presented detailed reports on their respective task implementation plans.
