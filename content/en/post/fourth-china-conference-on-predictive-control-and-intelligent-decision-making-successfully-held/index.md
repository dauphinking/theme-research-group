From May 10 to 12, 2024, the Fourth China Conference on Predictive Control and Intelligent Decision-Making (CPCID 2024) was successfully held in Hangzhou. The conference was organized by the Predictive Control and Intelligent Decision-Making Committee of the Chinese Association of Automation. The event attracted nearly 300 participants from universities, research institutions, and enterprises across the country, creating an intense atmosphere of academic discussion.

The three-day conference included pre-conference forums, keynote speeches, roundtable discussions, frontier forums, youth forums, and poster exhibitions. A total of 38 speakers shared their findings and engaged in discussions on topics such as predictive control and intelligent decision-making for complex systems, intelligent control and decision-making for autonomous unmanned systems, and the future development of predictive control. The exchange of ideas sparked lively discussions on the latest trends and research outcomes.

During the opening ceremony, Professor Zhang Xiaoqin, Vice President and Member of the Party Committee of Zhejiang University of Technology, and **Professor Li Dewei**, **Chairman of the Predictive Control and Intelligent Decision-Making Committee of the Chinese Association of Automation** and Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, delivered opening remarks. They expressed their warm congratulations on the event and hoped that the conference would serve as a broad platform for academic exchange and collaboration in the field of predictive control and intelligent decision-making. The goal is to foster more high-level research outcomes and facilitate the application of theoretical findings in industrial settings.

The conference featured keynote speeches by distinguished scholars, including Professor Yu Haibin, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and Professor at the Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Professor Guo Lei, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Professor at Beihang University; Professor Zhang Chenghui, IEEE Fellow and National High-Level Talent at Shandong University; Professor Du Wenli, National High-Level Talent at East China University of Science and Technology; and Professor Chen Wenhao, IEEE Fellow at Loughborough University. The sessions were chaired by Professor Xi Yugeng from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Professor Li Shaoyuan from Shanghai Jiao Tong University/Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Professor Liu Fei from Jiangnan University, Professor Xia Yuqing from Beijing Institute of Technology, and Professor Kang Yu from the University of Science and Technology of China.
