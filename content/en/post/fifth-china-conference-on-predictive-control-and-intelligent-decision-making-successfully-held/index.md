In his speech at the opening ceremony, Yang Zhenbin stated that as one of the important hubs for education, research, and talent in the field of automation in China, Shanghai Jiao Tong University has always taken serving national strategic needs as its mission, producing many pioneers such as Qian Xuesen, Shen Shangxian, Zhong Shimo, and Zhang Zhongjun. In recent years, SJTU has worked closely with peer institutions and industry partners, closely integrating academic exploration with national needs, and has continuously contributed wisdom in areas such as innovation in model predictive control algorithms and intelligent decision system architecture design. He looked forward to in-depth exchanges among the guests and the formation of more substantive cooperation.

On behalf of the Chinese Association of Automation, Zhou Donghua extended warm congratulations on the successful convening of the conference, highly praised SJTU's pioneering contributions in the field of predictive control, fully affirmed the university's important role in discipline development and talent cultivation, and expressed sincere gratitude to the mentors and seniors who guided and supported him during his studies at SJTU.

Conference Chair and SJTU Chair Professor Guan Xinping stated in his speech that predictive control technology has developed for more than 50 years and has become a core driving force for industrial upgrading. As the organizer, the School of Automation and Perception at SJTU will provide professional services for the conference and help promote technological breakthroughs and application implementation.

The conference held a launch ceremony for Professor Xi Yugeng's new book, "Model Predictive Controlâ€”Retrospect and Insights." Guo Lei, Yang Zhenbin, and Xi Yugeng jointly unveiled the new book. Xi Yugeng is one of the earliest experts in China to engage in predictive control research, and this work is a review and reflection on his research in the field.

The conference invited Guo Lei, Guan Xiaohong, Zhou Donghua, Zhongping Jiang (Academician of the European Academy of Sciences and Distinguished Professor at New York University), Shuzhi Sam Ge (Academician of the Singapore Academy of Engineering and Professor at the National University of Singapore), Hu Xiaoming (Professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden), and Sun Yang (Academician of the Canadian Academy of Engineering and Professor at the University of Victoria, Canada) to give keynote speeches. They shared cutting-edge academic views and in-depth analysis of technical challenges based on their latest research results and practical experience. The keynote sessions were chaired by Professors Wang Wei (Dalian University of Technology), Guan Xinping, Chen Hong (Tongji University), Li Shaoyuan (Shanghai Jiao Tong University/Qingdao University of Science and Technology), Yang Bo (Shanghai Jiao Tong University), Feng Enbo (East China University of Science and Technology), and Li Dewei (Shanghai Jiao Tong University).

In addition to the keynote speeches, the conference also featured academic seminars on retrospection and insights in predictive control, frontier forums, special sessions, and the Xi Yugeng Excellent Paper Award selection, focusing on cutting-edge topics such as complex system predictive control, AI-enabled optimization decision-making, and deep industrial applications.
