  Developed predictive control strategies for electric vehicle thermal management, covering cooling, heating, dehumidification, and defrosting modes. Utilized MATLAB, Simulink, and Dymola for system modeling and validation, with HIL testing for real-time application. Collaborated with Shanghai Songzhi to create China's first climate wind tunnel, achieving wind speed stability ±0.5 kph and temperature stability ±0.2°C.

Developed predictive control strategies for multi-mode thermal management systems in electric vehicles:

**Thermal Modes:**

Cooling, heating, dehumidification, defrosting, and combined modes for battery and cabin temperature regulation.

**Advanced Control Methods:**

* Multi-variable system modeling using MATLAB and Simulink for control design.
* Physical simulation through Dymola to validate thermal system performance.
* Integrated hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing for real-time application validation.

**Example Application:**

Collaborated with Shanghai Songzhi to develop China's first independently designed climate wind tunnel system for electric vehicles.

**Achieved precise control results:**

* Wind speed stability: ±0.5 kph, overshoot <0.2%.
* Temperature stability: ±0.2°C, deviation <5%.
* Humidity stability: ±2% RH, deviation <5%.
