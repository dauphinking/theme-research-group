Real-Time Detection: Uses LiDAR sensors to monitor pedestrian activity with high accuracy.

Adaptive Control: Adjusts signal timing dynamically to balance pedestrian and vehicle traffic priorities.

Advanced Analytics: Enhances reliability in low-visibility and crowded scenarios.

Targeted Deployment: Ideal for high-traffic urban areas with significant pedestrian activity.
