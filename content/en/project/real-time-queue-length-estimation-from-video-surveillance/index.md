Description:

Data Extraction: Analyzes video footage to extract vehicle trajectories and queue patterns.

Model Integration: Combines trajectory data with following models to reconstruct queue states dynamically.

Challenges Addressed: Mitigates issues like occlusions in video feeds and dynamic variations in traffic flow.

Applications: Optimizes red light timing and reduces congestion at high-demand intersections by accurately estimating queue lengths.
