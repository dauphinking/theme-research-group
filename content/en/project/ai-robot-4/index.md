## Project Overview:

The AI Vision Inspection Robot is a highly efficient intelligent inspection system focused on 3D dimensional measurement and surface defect detection. Through AI technology, the robot achieves precise automatic recognition and classification, particularly suitable for quality control needs in metal processing, welding, and production lines. Its modular design allows for adjustment of working modes according to different inspection targets.

## Core Features:

- **Precise Detection**: AI-based automatic defect recognition and 3D measurement, accurately locating cracks, dents, and other imperfections.
- **Multi-functional Integration**: Supports real-time data analysis, classification, and report generation.
- **Modular Structure**: Easy to adjust and upgrade, adapting to diverse industrial needs.
- **Automated Process Management**: Deep integration with production lines, achieving automated inspection and sorting.

## Application Scenarios:
Suitable for product quality control in steel, welding, pipeline manufacturing, and other fields, including:

- Steel surface defect detection
- Welding quality analysis
- Pipeline non-destructive testing

## Client Implementation:
Baosteel Group has implemented this system on a large scale in their production lines, achieving efficient quality control.
