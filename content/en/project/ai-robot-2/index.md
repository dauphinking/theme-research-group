## Project Overview

The Wheeled AI Inspection Robot System, designed for open and complex industrial environments, is based on precise positioning and navigation algorithms and advanced visual AI recognition technology. The robot is equipped with voice interaction, intelligent obstacle avoidance, and data collection modules, capable of flexibly handling various inspection tasks while automatically generating inspection reports, significantly improving industrial inspection efficiency and safety.

## Core Features:

- **Intelligent Navigation & Obstacle Avoidance**: Precise positioning algorithms ensure efficient path planning while detecting and quickly adjusting to surrounding obstacles.
- **Real-time Monitoring & Analysis**: HD cameras and sensors capture on-site data, with AI algorithms automatically generating anomaly analysis reports.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Supports quick deployment across multiple scenarios and environments.
- **Remote Control & Collaboration**: Real-time information synchronization with backend systems through wireless networks, enabling remote command and collaboration.

## Application Scenarios
Widely applied in the following areas:

- Chemical industrial parks
- Industrial plants
- Office buildings
- Parking lots and more

## Client Implementation
Large enterprises such as Sinopec Qilu Petrochemical have fully deployed this system for inspecting critical production facilities.
