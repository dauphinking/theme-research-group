* **Aggregation MPC (Model Predictive Control)**:

  * Introduced a generalized linear aggregation framework for MPC.
  * Developed equivalent aggregation concepts to simplify optimization problems, enabling real-time applicability.
  * Optimized the separation between offline (design phase) and online (real-time execution) computations to ensure high efficiency.

* **Applications**:

  * **Air Separation Systems**

    * Controlled fluctuations in process variables during separation.
    * Enabled rapid tracking of operational setpoints under external load changes.
    * Successfully tested embedded (DSP-based) predictive controllers in industrial settings.
  * **Injection Molding Systems**

    * Minimized transient pressure fluctuations during the hold pressure phase, improving product quality.
    * Reduced energy consumption and increased stability in high-volume production environments.
  * **Photovoltaic Inverter Systems**

    * Optimized the duty cycle to minimize harmonic distortions and waveform irregularities.
    * Nominated for the 2014 Chinese Control Conference Guang Zhi Zhi Award for these innovations.
  * **Boiler Combustion Control System**

    * Collaboration between the research team and XinHua/GE Control Company on a dry clinker production project in cement plants, utilizing the CSC Laboratory's embedded MPC (Model Predictive Control) controller.
    * Energy Savings: Achieved average coal savings of 6%, with a peak efficiency of 8% in relevant processes.
