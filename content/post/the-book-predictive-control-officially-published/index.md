The book "Predictive Control," co-authored by Professors Xi Yugeng and Li Dewei from our laboratory, has been officially published.

The main content of this book is based on the second edition of the Chinese version "Predictive Control," published in 2013. The theoretical foundation comes from the research achievements of the team led by Professor Xi Yugeng over the past thirty years. This team is one of the earliest in China to engage in the theoretical research of predictive control. Through thirty years of dedicated research, they have pioneered and established a theoretical framework for the predictive control of complex systems, leading the development of predictive control in China. This work has supported the advancement of control theory and technology in various industrial fields, including automation, computer science, mechanical engineering, and materials processing, over the past nearly thirty years. To help readers better understand the field of predictive control, this book includes some cutting-edge and representative research cases in the field.
