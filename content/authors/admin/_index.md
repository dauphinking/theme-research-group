My research interests include complex system optimization and control, intelligent robotics, energy internet, and smart transportation.

I have published over 300 papers in prestigious journals and conferences such as Automatica and IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. I hold 10 patents, 11 software copyrights, and have authored 1 monograph. Additionally, I have edited 2 special issues for international journals. Currently, I serve as the Chair of the Predictive Control and Intelligent Decision Special Committee of the Chinese Association of Automation, a member of the Control Theory and Application Education Working Group, and an editorial board member of the renowned journal Control Engineering Practice. I have led over 20 projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation, the National Education Commission, the Shanghai Education Commission, and the National 863 Program. I have also undertaken more than 30 industry-commissioned projects.

I have been awarded the Shanghai Excellent Doctoral Dissertation, the National Natural Science Second Prize, the Chinese Association of Automation Natural Science First Prize, the China Invention Association Innovation and Entrepreneurship First Prize, the Chinese Association of Automation Technology Invention Second Prize, and the Shanghai Science and Technology Progress First Prize.
